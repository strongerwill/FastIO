\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:con}

Current page table management to the paravirtual guest OS focuses on the security guarantees of the hypervisor, which induces two important performance issues by introducing a long execution path of page table (de)allocation and extra IOTLB flushes. For page table (de)allocations, existing complex memory allocator introduces deep invocations while the security validation module further adds costs by enforcing both software and DMA validations, which consequently hamper the performance of process creations/exits. Besides, the validation module also introduces a large number of IOTLB flushes when processes are created concurrently, resulting in the increase of IOTLB miss. We can foresee that the IOTLB miss will noticeably increase the performance overhead of I/O devices when their speed are becoming faster. We propose \name to solve those identified problems, a lightweight approach that dramatically shortens the execution length of page table (de)allocation by introducing a dedicated buffer and completely eliminates IOTLB flushes by a find-grained validation module except in the worst case.
