% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file.

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

\begin{abstract}
In paravirtualization, the page table management components of the guest operating systems are properly patched for the security guarantees of the hypervisor.
However, none of them pay enough attentions to the performance improvements, which result in two noticeable issues.
First, such security patches exacerbate the problem that the execution path of the guest page table (de)allocation becomes extremely long, which would consequently increase the latencies of the processes' creations and exits.
Second, the security validations introduce many additional IOTLB flushes. Obviously, they would lead to extra IOTLB misses, and many have negative impacts on the I/O performance of all peripheral devices.


In this paper, we propose \name, a novel lightweight approach for improving the performance in page table management.
First, \name shortens the length of the execution path of the page table (de)allocations by a page table cache, which maintains a dedicated buffer for serving page table (de)allocations.
Second, \name eliminates the additional IOTLB misses with a fine-grained validation scheme, which perform DMA and software validations separately, instead of doing both together as before.
We implement a prototype on Xen with Linux as the guest kernel. We do small modifications of Xen ($166$ SLoC) and Linux kernel ($350$ SLoC).
We evaluate the I/O performance in both micro and macro ways.
The micro experiment results indicate that \name is able to \emph{completely eliminates} the additional IOTLB flushes, and effectively reduces (de)allocation time of the page table by xx\% on average. 
In worst cases, the additional latency is only xx\%.
The macro benchmarks show that the latencies of the process creations and exits are expectedly reduced by xx\% and xx\% on average respectively.
Moreover, \name has no negative impacts on CPU computation, network I/O and disk I/O.

\end{document}

IOMMUs have been pervasively deployed on paravirtualized systems for the protection of the hypervisor and the security-critical data structures, e.g., the shared page tables. According to our observations, certain updates of the guest VM's page tables that are supposed to be orthogonal to the device I/O performance, would surprisingly lead to a large number of IOTLB misses. It implies that the I/O performance of all peripheral devices will be affected by the seemingly unrelated guest page table updates. Unfortunately, no existing work uncovers this dependency and adjusts the design of the paravirtualized hypervisor and the guest operating system.
