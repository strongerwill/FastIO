% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of

% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.

% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file.

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

\begin{abstract}
In paravirtualization, the page table management components of the guest operating systems are properly patched for the security guarantees of the hypervisor.
However, none of them pay enough attentions to the performance improvements, which results in two noticeable issues.
The first one is the long execution paths of the page table (de)allocations, which consequently increase the latencies of the creations and exits of processes.
The other one is the additional IOTLB flushes introduced by the security validations during the page table (de)allocation, which inevitably introduces extra IOTLB misses, and would intuitively introduce negative impacts on the I/O performance of all peripheral devices.


In this paper, we propose Page-Table Cache (\name), a novel software-only approach for improving the performance in page table management.
First, \name shortens the length of the execution path of the page table (de)allocations by a page table cache, which maintains a dedicated buffer for serving page table (de)allocations.
Second, \name eliminates the additional IOTLB misses with a fine-grained validation scheme, which separates the DMA and software validations, instead of verifying both together as before.
We implement a prototype on Xen with Linux as the guest kernel. We do small modifications of Xen version 4.2.1 ($166$ SLoC) and Linux kernel version 3.2.0 ($350$ SLoC).
We evaluate the I/O performance in both micro and macro ways.
The micro experiment results indicate that \name is able to completely eliminates the additional IOTLB flushes, and effectively reduces (de)allocation time of the page table by xx\% on average. 
The macro benchmarks show that there is no negative impact on the CPU computation, network I/O and disk I/O. 
Moreover, the latencies of the process creations and exits are expectedly reduced by xx\% on average.

IOMMUs have been pervasively deployed on paravirtualized systems for the protection of the hypervisor and the security-critical data structures, e.g., the shared page tables. According to our observations, certain updates of the guest VM's page tables that are supposed to be orthogonal to the device I/O performance, would surprisingly lead to a large number of IOTLB misses. It implies that the I/O performance of all peripheral devices will be affected by the seemingly unrelated guest page table updates. Unfortunately, no existing work uncovers this dependency and adjusts the design of the paravirtualized hypervisor and the guest operating system.
