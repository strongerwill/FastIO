% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of

% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,

% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to

% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file.

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

\subsection*{Abstract}

IOMMUs have been pervasively deployed on paravirtualized systems for the protection of the hypervisor and the security-critical data structures, e.g., the shared page tables. According to our observations, certain updates of the guest VM's page tables that are supposed to be orthogonal to the device I/O performance, would surprisingly lead to a large numbers of IOTLB misses. It implies that the I/O performances of all peripheral devices will be affected by the seemingly unrelated guest page table updates. Until now, researchers and developers are not aware of the existence of this dependence and do not consequently adjust the design of the paravirtualized hypervisor and the guest operating systems.

In this paper, we are the first one to deeply demonstrate the impact upon the device I/O performance due to the page table updates. Then we propose \name (I/O Speed-UP), a novel software-only approach for minimizing the negative impacts, without sacrificing the security of the hypervisor.
By maintaining a page-table cache, \name not only successfully decreases the IOTLB flushes, but also accelarates the creations and exits of user processes.
We implement an prototype on Xen with Linux as the guest VM's kernel. We do small modifications of Xen (xxx SLoC) and Linux kernel version 3.2.0 (xxx SLoC). We evaluate the I/O performance in both micro and macro ways. The micro experiment results indicate that \name is able to effectively reduce the flush rate of IOTLB from xxx to zero with less CPU usage, even when the page tables are frequently updated. The macro benchmarks shows that the I/O devices always produce better (or the same) performance, even when the system frequently generate many temporal processes.

%Now we get serious and fill in those references.  Remember you will
%have to run latex twice on the document in order to resolve those
%cite tags you met earlier.  This is where they get resolved.
%We've preserved some real ones in addition to the template-speak.
%After the bibliography you are DONE.
