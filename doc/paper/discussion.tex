As talked before, when to free pages in the cache pool relies on both the absolute memory size and the proportion. Default thresholds of the two factors are determined by a specific experiment, where both thresholds are measured in the busy setting (created by a specific stress tool) when no pages are freed to the buddy system. Therefore, measurements of the thresholds are heavily dependent on a specific setting, which may not work in other situations. If the operation of freeing pages occurs frequently, IOTLB also flushes often. This is why we provide an interface for users to manually modify the default values of thresholds. Nevertheless, the approach of developing the interface is not flexible enough and we plan to put forward a self-adaption algorithm in the future work. Basically, the algorithm is invoked periodically, adjusting the memory usage of the cache pool according to the memory usage of created page tables in a target application, current frequency of IOTLB flush. When users dynamically enable the cache mechanism for the application, the algorithm could automatically initialise the absolute memory usage by scanning the page numbers in cache and in page-table and thus determine the proportion between them. Note that the proportion differs in each level of cache, sice PTE is used more often than both PGD and PMD. The algorithm will properly increase the threshold of the total memory size, if IOTLB is found out to be flushing during its running period. While the memory cache is larger enough, beyond a certain percentage of the application's whole memory size, the algorithm is supposed to free the exceeded memory pages even if the frequency of IOTLB flush does not drop to zero.

%has the properties as follows.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item (P1) Frequency of IOTLB flush will reach the zero level as soon as possible.
%\item (P2) Memory usage of the cache pool is under control. 
%\item (P3) 
%\item (P4) 
%\end{enumerate}
