%introduce full virtualization, then move onto PV for performance and finally introduce the security and performance issues.
%VMware~\cite{devine2002virtualization} implements a full virtualization of the underlying computer hardware and allows unmodified guest OSes to execute on a hypervisor, which has degraded the system performance. Denali~\cite{whitaker2002scale} is the first to develop paravirtualization techniques to achieve high performance for modified VMs running network services while Xen~\cite{barham2003xen} is intended to support real operating systems hosting industry standard applications, which makes Xen become popular and widely used in cloud computing. And how to improve its security and performance becomes a major concern.

%talk about how to improve Xen's security.
%Murray \emph{et al.}~\cite{disaggregation} manage to reduce trusted computing base (TCB) of a Xen-based system, which moves the VM-building component from the privileged VM, namely \emph{Domain 0} into a small and trusted compartment.
%Xoar~\cite{colp2011breaking} is proposed to protect Xen hypervisor by breaking the \emph{Domain 0} into several single-purpose components, and each component is configured to expose its dedicated interfaces to VMs and have the least required-privilege access to the hypervisor, also resulting in a reduction of TCB. CloudVisor~\cite{zhang2011cloudvisor} is introduced to prevent leakage of users's data inside a VM by breaking Xen hypervisor into both a resource management module and a nested security monitor and the monitor is responsible for providing protection to the VMs, largely improving Xen's security.

%improve I/O performance for paravirtual I/O method
%As I/O activity is an important performance factor in virtualized environments, the paravirtual I/O method introduced by Xen is efficient to transfer I/O data. Instead of emulating hardware devices, Xen asks the \emph{backend} of a device running in the \emph{driver domain} to communicate with the \emph{frontend} of that device residing in a guest domain by passing the data info through shared-memory, etc. Har'El \emph{et al.}~\cite{har2013efficient} claim to provide a more efficient paravirtual I/O system by combing a fine-grained I/O scheduling and exitless notifications with separate cores, each core dedicated to handling one domain's I/O requests. Besides, to approach bare-metal performance for VMs that interact with I/O devices directly, ELI~\cite{eli} is presented to remove the hypervisor from the I/O interrupt handling path while handle the interrupts within VMs securely.

%talk about IOMMU performance when it is armed by Xen
%As the paravirtual I/O method is not secure enough for DMA access~\cite{disaggregation}, IOMMU (AMD-Vi~\cite{amdvt} or Intel VT-d~\cite{intelvt}) is armed by Xen to prevent buggy device drivers from overwriting system's memory, which subsequently introduces new I/O performance issues. On top of that, Willmann \emph{et al.}~\cite{willmann2008protection} proposes new strategies for Xen to configure IOMMU in order to reduce I/O performance overhead without sacrificing Xen's security. Particularly, Amit \emph{et al.}~\cite{amit2012iommu} and Malka \emph{et al.}~\cite{malka2015riommu} deeply analyze the role of IOMMU's IOTLB in DMA operations and quantifies bottleneck overhead of IOTLB in the high I/O performance environments.

%introduce our work
%In our work, we are focusing on the page table (de)allocations of paravirtual OS. When an OS is ported to Xen, there exists long execution paths of the guest page table (de)allocations and additional IOTLB flushes due to the security validations for page table (de)allocations. Because of the two performance issues, \name is presented to efficiently cut down the execution length and completely eliminate IOTLB flushes, resulting in better performance for both OS and IOMMU.

%Although the hypervisor provides valuable services for memory access from both sides, it is far from enough.
%so as to reduce the performance degradation for the OS inside a VM while prevent illicit access or faults from the OS, achieving a good tradeoff between performance and safety for software access.
%NoHype~\cite{keller2010nohype}
%in its original design, Xen uses an efficient
%Ben-Yehuda~\cite{ben2008xen} talks about the I/O virtualization of Xen by IOMMU~\cite{intelvt,amdvt}, which not only allows direct access to I/O devices by untrusted VMs but prevents buggy device drivers from overwriting system's memory, thereby largely improving the system's availability and reliability for DMA access.

%introduce
%In our work, we focus on the paravirtual page table (de)allocations as well as their impacts on the IOTLB performance. The related work will be introduced from the two aspects as follows.
\mypara{Guest Page Table Protection}
%In paravirtualization, the hypervisor and guest OS are sharing the same virtual space.
%As a result, the guest page table becomes the security critical data structure.
In paravirtualization, the guest page table becomes the security critical data structure.
To protect the integrity of the page table and allow legitimate updates, Xen~\cite{barham2003xen} sets the guest page table as read-only and validates every update of guest page tables so as to prevent any malicious access.
However, the protected guest page table is still writable for DMA requests~\cite{disaggregation,adams2006comparison}.
To fix this gap, the hypervisor has to enable the I/O virtualization (AMD-Vi~\cite{amdvt} or Intel VT-d~\cite{intelvt}) technology, preventing any DMA access on the guest page table.
In this paper, we do not break or downgrade the page-table base security, instead we keep its security and accelerate the performance in the page table management.


\mypara{IOTLB Misses Reduction}
There are some existing approaches~\cite{amit2012iommu, malka2015riommu, willmann2008protection} analyzing and reducing the negative effects of the IOTLB misses.
Amit et al.~\cite{amit2012iommu} firstly analyze the role of the IOTLB in DMA operations and quantifies the performance overhead of IOTLB misses. Then they present new strategies of both software and hardware enhancements to reduce IOTLB miss rate in order to facilitate DMA address translation. rIOMMU~\cite{malka2015riommu} re-designs the architecture of IOMMU to achieve high performance in DMA transactions, during which the IOTLB misses are also largely reduced. Willmann et al.~\cite{willmann2008protection} proposes new strategies for Xen to re-configure the addressing mode of IOMMU, resulting in fewer IOTLB misses.
Different from the previous approaches that attempt to reduce the overall IOTLB misses, our approach mainly focuses on eliminating the additional IOTLB misses introduced by the security validations (i.e., the DMA validation) during the guest page table allocations and deallocations.

\mypara{Other I/O Performance Improvements}
%The paravirtual I/O technique is introduced by Xen~\cite{barham2003xen}, which is a software-only solution to provide efficient I/O for guest VMs.
%In the paravirtul I/O, the device driver is split the device interface into two parts: 1) the frontend residing in the unprivileged guest domains and 2) the backend residing in the privileged domain(e.g., driver domain or Dom0). They work together through a virtual communication channel, e.g., the shared memory.
There are many schemes trying to improve the I/O performance in different directions.
The approaches~\cite{menon2006optimizing,4734994,santos2008bridging} aim to improve the network throughput by optimizing the paravirtual I/O model on network.
In CDNA~\cite{cdna}, the authors propose a method for concurrent and direct network access for virtual machines.
Ongaro et al.~\cite{ongaro2008scheduling} study the impacts of guest scheduling on guest I/O performance by concurrently running different combinations of processor-intensive, bandwidth-intensive and latency-sensitive workloads. The approaches in~\cite{gordon2012towards,har2013efficient} attempt to reduce the number of VM exits. The studies in~\cite{liao2008software,liu2009virtualization,shalev2010isostack,landau2011splitx,xu2013vturbo} accelerate I/O performance by  designating cores to specific uses.
%For instance, vTurbo~\cite{xu2013vturbo} facilitates I/O processing for virtual machines by offloading the processing to a designated core with a smaller time-slice than usual.
Several studies, like ELI~\cite{eli} and vIC~\cite{vic} attempt to reduce the overhead of I/O interrupts in virtual environments.


%\emph{Direct I/O}


%With the aid of IOMMU, virtual machines can interact with devices directly and securely (a.k.a., direct assignment), which enhances the I/O performance. But it is not enough, ELI~\cite{eli} is introduced to remove the hypervisor from the I/O interrupt handling path while handle the interrupts within VMs securely, thereby approaching bare-metal I/O performance.
