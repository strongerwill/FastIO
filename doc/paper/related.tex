In the paravirtualised setting, a VM takes responsibility for (de)allocating its own page tables while hypervisor~\cite{x86-pv-model,barham2003xen,pratt2005xen,chisnall2008definitive} is only involved in the page table updates so as to prevent its illicit access or faults, achieving a good tradeoff between performance and safety for software access.
Besides, the hypervisor armed with IOMMU~\cite{ben2008xen,intelvt,amdvt} allows direct access to I/O devices by untrusted VMs while prevents buggy device drivers from overwriting any part of the system's memory, thereby largely improving the system's availability and reliability for DMA access.

Although the hypervisor provides valuable services for memory access from both sides, it is far from enough.
