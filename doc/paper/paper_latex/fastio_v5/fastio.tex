\subsection*{Abstract}

IOMMUs have been pervasively deployed on paravirtualized systems for the protection of the hypervisor and the security-critical data structures, e.g., the shared guest page tables. According to our observations, the updates of the guest page tables that are supposed to be orthogonal to the device I/O performance, would surprisingly lead to a large numbers of IOTLB misses. It implies that the I/O performances of all peripheral devices will be affected by the seemingly unrelated guest page table updates. Until now, researchers and developers are not aware of the existence of this dependence and do not consequently adjust the design of the paravirtualized hypervisor and the guest operating systems.

In this paper, we are the first one to deeply demonstrate the impact upon the device I/O performance due to the page table updates. To minimize the impact, we propose \name(I/O Speed-UP), a novel software-only approach for decreasing the IOTLB misses, as well as retaining the security of hypervisor.
We also implement an prototype on Xen and Linux kernel. We do small modifications of Xen (xxx SLoC) and Linux kernel version 3.2.0 (xxx SLoC). We also evaluate the I/O performance in both micro and macro ways. The micro experiment results indicate that the new algorithm is able to effectively reduce the miss rate of IOTLB with even less CPU usage, especially when the page tables are frequently updated. The macro benchmarks shows that the I/O devices always produce better (or the same) performance, especially when the system frequently generate many temporal processes.
