%overview
To solve the problem, \name associates a new page type with a page in the 
hypervisor while provides every level of page-table cache pool for guest OS 
. As revealed in previous sections, a writable page is writable to both guest
OS and I/O devices, and guest OS has only a readable mapping to a page-table
page while devices have no access to it. Because of that, we introduce a new
page type called \textbf{ready} that can be write-accessed by OS while
inaccessible to devices. When OS writes ready pages as new page tables and
submits the request of updating page tables, Xen will not have to unmap them
from I/O page tables, thus reducing IOTLB-flushes. 
Besides, since page type is transparent to the OS, it needs to build a
cache pool especially for the ready-type pages rather than free them into the
buddy system which reserves only writable pages. Also, the cache pool benefits time efficiency when creating/destructing a page-table. 


%firstly, talk about how to reduce the IOTLB flush.
%secondly, design the cache pool to support it
